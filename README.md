# Full Stack Open

# Description

I built this project as part of the Full Stack Open course curriculum. The course provided a structured learning path and hands-on exercises to help me develop my skills in full-stack web development. By completing the assignments and projects in this repository, I aimed to apply the concepts learned in the course and strengthen my understanding of building web applications.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several parts, each focusing on different topics and technologies. Here's the structure of the repository:

- **Part 0**: Fundamentals of Web Development
- **Part 1**: Introduction to React


Each part consists of multiple exercises and projects that build upon the concepts learned in the course. 

## Usage

You can find the assignments number and their corresponding solutions in the respective part folders. Each part may have its own README file with detailed instructions and explanations. Follow the instructions provided to set up and run the assignments or projects.
